# feature-importance
An investigation into feature importance variability in L2 word learning accuracy.

# ABSTRACT
Why does a Machine Learning algorithm choose one output over another? 
Can the feature importance parameter in Decision Trees provide some insight into this? 
Is there any empirical relation between these feature importances and the regression coefficients in Linear Regression?
This project attempts to tackle these questions by running multi-model regression analyses
on a large scale Duolingo L2 word learning dataset.
